 Microsoft EULA for Northwind Database
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All of the databases required for this sample application have been included in
 the self extracing zip file.  One of those databases is the Microsoft Northwind
 Database.  You can find the Microsoft EULA for the Northwind database in the 
 Northwind EULA.txt file that accompanies this installation program.  By using 
 the sample application, you agree to its terms.  


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation Directory
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 C:\Pro ASP.NET 2.0\


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Using the Sample Applications
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After running the self-extracing zip file, you can find the sample application 
 files in the directory listed above. Many of the connection strings in the 
 application are pre-configured to use this path, so it is recommended that you 
 leave the files in the default directory. You may opt to move them to a 
 different directory, but you will have to update the connection strings in the 
 web.config to match the alternate directory.

 All of the databases required to run the sample applications have been
 included in the zip file, but they do require SQL Server 2005 Express to
 function.  SQL Server 2005 Express is available as an optional install with
 Visual Studio 2005.  Please consult your installation media for information
 regarding the installation of SQL Server 2005 Express.
 
 Each chapter has a folder containing a solution file for the chapter.  When you
 want to see the sample code for a particular chapter, just open the chapter's
 solution file, look at the code, and run the sample application.  You will find
 instructions on each individual page to help walk you through each sample.

 It is recommended that you run the sample applications using the built-in 
 development web server in Visual Studio 2005.  If you opt to use IIS, then
 you may have to do some manual configuration to get some of the applications
 to work (security settings, application mappings, etc).  s
