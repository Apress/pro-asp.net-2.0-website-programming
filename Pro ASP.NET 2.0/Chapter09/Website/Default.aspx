    On the business side, there are three reasons for developing against a reporting framework:
    speed, accuracy, and consistency. All the tedious reporting logic is written once and
    encapsulated in a reusable reporting component. You can then leverage the component whenever
    needed instead of copying and pasting code from page to page or starting over from
    scratch. This speeds up report creation significantly, which ultimately helps meet deadlines
    and keep projects on time and on budget.<br /><br />
