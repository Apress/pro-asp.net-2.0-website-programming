    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    
    From a business perspective, one of the biggest benefits of searching is application
    usability. Sites with little or no searching functionality usually generate a greater 
    number of complaints and help requests than sites where searching is well thought out 
    and implemented. People who can easily find information are happy. People who cannot 
    find information are not happy and can quickly become irate depending on the 
    deadlines under which they are working. Usually these people end up calling someone 
    for help or just to complain about their dilemma. If the person they are calling 
    happens to be you, then just think about how much time you can save yourself in the 
    future by implementing appropriate search features now.<br /><br />
