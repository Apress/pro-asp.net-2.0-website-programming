    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br /> 
    Appearance matters. Whether you like it or not, people make decisions about how well they
    like your application and how well they think it works based on its visual appearance. Web
    applications exhibiting a consistent look and feel exude professionalism and instill confidence
    in users that the application is well built and reliable. People naturally conclude that the attention
    to the visual design is on par with that of the functional capabilities of the application.
    First glances aside, consistency also enhances the user experience because people feel most
    comfortable when they are in a familiar environment. By creating a consistent location for
    certain page elements, users will inherently know how to get around in your application even
    when accessing pages to which they are not normally accustomed.<br /><br />
