    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    
    Building an application is a far easier task when you have the appropriate reusable components
    at your disposal. Reusable components allow you to implement functionality more
    easily, more accurately, and faster than you could by copying and pasting code from one place
    to another or re-implementing it each time you need it. Plus, you have the added benefit of
    updating a reusable component from a single location instead of having to rummage through
    each page in your project to apply a fix. Before you begin a project, you should always take time
    out with your project team to brainstorm a list of features in your application that can be
    consolidated into reusable components, and you should budget time to implement those
    components. You will find that although custom components take a big chunk out of your
    initial development time, they save a lot more time in the long run.<br /><br />
