    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    
    ASP.NET 2.0 features a new web-based Wizard control that allows you to guide a user
    through a well-defined, step-by-step process. You can use wizards for just about anything 
    that you want, including searching, reporting, and displaying information. This sample project 
    shows you how to create a web-based wizard that requires users to search for duplicates as 
    part of the adding process.<br /><br />       
    
    This project contains samples from Chapter 10 in the book. Please use the navigation
    menu on the left hand side of each page to navigate through the samples. Instructions
    on how to use the samples are included on each page, where applicable.
