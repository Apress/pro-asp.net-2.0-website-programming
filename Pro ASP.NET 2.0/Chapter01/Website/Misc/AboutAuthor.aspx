Damon Armstrong has been developing business applications for almost 10 years and has a
passion for just about every web-based technology on the planet. Currently, he is a technology
consultant with Telligent Systems in Dallas, Texas, where he works with some of the most
active and knowledgeable people in the .NET community, specializes in ASP.NET, and has
recently been focusing on client development projects for early adopters of ASP.NET 2.0. He is
certified in VB .NET and ASP.NET, and holds a Bachelors of Business Administration in
Management of Information Systems from the University of Texas at Dallas.<br /><br />Damon lives in Carrollton, Texas, with his wife Teresa Kae and their black-lab mix Cloe.
When he’s not in front of a computer, he’s usually out playing softball, disc golf, or procrastinating
on some home-improvement project. He’s also a leader, along with his wife and a bunch
of other absolutely awesome people, with Carrollton Young Life. He can be contacted at

Damien Foggon is a freelance programmer and technical author based in Newcastle,
England. He’s technical director of Thing-E Ltd., a company specializing in the development of
dynamic web solutions for the education sector, and founder of Littlepond Ltd. He started out

massive monolithic developments that still exist out there.<br /><br />Damien has coauthored books for Microsoft Press and Apress and acted as a
technical reviewer for both Wrox and Apress. His first solo outing as an author, Beginning
ASP.NET 2.0 Databases (also from Apress), will be arriving soon. He can be contacted at
