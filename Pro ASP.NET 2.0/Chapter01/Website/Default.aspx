    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    Proper configuration practices are essential to making a project cost effective over the
    entire software development lifecycle. Unfortunately, budgetary and time constraints often
    convince developers to forgo those practices and rush into other areas of development without
    giving much thought to the long-term consequences. If you plan and budget time at the beginning
    of a project to properly deal with configuration issues, then you will likely reduce the
    overall time required to develop the project.<br /><br />
