    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    
    Personalization is based on user-specific information that outlines preferences or behaviors.
    You can use the new profile functionality in ASP.NET 2.0 to quickly and easily store
    information about the people who visit your website or use your application. You can then use
    that profile information to adjust the content of your site according to the specific information
    you have gathered about the visitors.<br /><br />
