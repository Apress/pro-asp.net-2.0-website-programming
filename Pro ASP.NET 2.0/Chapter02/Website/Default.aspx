    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />    
    Applications have errors. It’s an inevitable consequence of the development process arising
    from our inability to account for every possible scenario in which something may go awry.  
    How you handle those unexpected errors and what you learn from them is what will ultimately 
    set you apart.<br /><br />
    
    This project contains samples from Chapter 2 in the book. Please use the navigation
    menu on the left hand side of each page to navigate through the samples. Instructions
    on how to use the samples are included on each page, where applicable.<br /><br />
    
    Also make sure to check out App_Code/ExceptionBasics.vb in the sample code for a demonstration of exception handling basics.
