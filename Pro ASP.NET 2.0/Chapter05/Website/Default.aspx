    <strong></strong><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
    
    Microsoft augmented Forms Authentication by releasing a series of pretty spectacular
    providers and login controls that automatically handle all the grunt work associated with user
    management for your site. The membership provider can automatically create a user-management
    database capable of storing user and roles. The Web Site Administration Tool gives you a
    way to add, edit, and delete users and their respective roles in that database. The login controls
    automatically authenticate users from the database and load the appropriate user
    and their roles into the request context. In other words, you can implement an entire user-management
    system for your application without having to write a single line of code.<br /><br />
